## ✅ Auth Code Cleanup Complete!

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables (STILL NEEDED!)
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

## 📊 Current Security Posture

| Item | Status | Risk Level |
|------|--------|------------|
| OAuth Secret Rotated | ✅ Complete | LOW |
| Master Branch | ✅ Cleaned | LOW |
| Feature Branches | ✅ Cleaned | LOW |
| Vercel Variables | ⚠️ Need Update | HIGH |
| Private Branch | ✅ Created | LOW |

## 🎯 Priority Actions

1. **NOW**: Update Vercel environment variables
2. **Next 15 min**: Clean all public feature branches
3. **Next 30 min**: Push all changes and test auth

Your OAuth credentials are now secure locally, but you must update Vercel for production security!
