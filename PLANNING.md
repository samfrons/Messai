## 🎯 Core Planning Documents

### 1. Master Plan (`/plan.md`)
The master plan defines:
- **Project Vision**: Unified electrochemical systems platform
- **Core vs Future Features**: Clear scope boundaries
- **Tech Stack**: Locked-in technology decisions
- **Phase Timeline**: 6 phases from foundation to optimization
- **Success Metrics**: Technical, user, and business KPIs

### 2. Phase Documentation (`/phases/`)
Each phase includes:
- **Objective**: Clear, single-sentence goal
- **Deliverables**: Specific, measurable outputs
- **Timeline**: Start date, end date, duration
- **Task Breakdown**: Weekly sprint structure
- **Success Criteria**: How we verify completion

### 3. Current Status (`/phases/current-phase.json`)
Real-time tracking of:
- Active phase number and name
- Progress percentage
- Task status (completed/active/upcoming)
- Key dates and milestones

## 📊 Current Project Status

### Completed Phases ✅
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Dec 2024)
   - Next.js 15 setup, database design, 3D framework
   - Multi-branch architecture, basic UI components

2. **Phase 2: Research System** (Jan 2025)
   - 3,721 research papers, AI extraction pipeline
   - Advanced search/filtering, quality validation

### Active Phase 🔄
3. **Phase 3: Laboratory Tools** (40% complete)
   - Bioreactor design tool
   - Electroanalytical interface
   - Material optimization

### Upcoming Phases 📅
4. **Phase 4: Integration** (Feb-Mar 2025)
   - Unified dashboard, workflow automation
   - Cross-feature data sharing, API documentation

5. **Phase 5: Experiment Platform** (Mar-Apr 2025)
   - Experiment lifecycle management
   - Collaboration features, report generation

6. **Phase 6: Optimization** (Apr-May 2025)
   - Performance improvements, mobile optimization
   - Advanced caching, load testing

## 🔧 Using the Planning System

### For AI Agents

1. **Start a new task**: Check `/plan.md` and current phase
2. **Understand scope**: Review phase documentation in `/phases/active/`
3. **Prevent overreach**: Stick to current phase deliverables
4. **Track progress**: Update task status in phase files
5. **Check dependencies**: Verify prerequisites before starting

### For Human Developers

1. **Check status**: `npm run phase:status`
2. **Update progress**: Mark tasks with ✅ when complete
3. **Review phases**: Check upcoming work in `/phases/upcoming/`
4. **Plan features**: Use templates in `/planning-templates/`
5. **Transition phases**: `npm run phase:check` when ready

## 🚀 Phase Management Commands

```bash
# Check current phase status
npm run phase:status

# Check if phase is complete and transition
npm run phase:check

# Generate comprehensive status report
npm run phase:report

# Force transition to next phase (use carefully)
npm run phase:transition
```

## 📝 Planning Best Practices

### 1. Maintain Focus
- Work only on current phase tasks
- Resist adding "nice to have" features mid-phase
- Document ideas for future phases

### 2. Clear Communication
- Update task status regularly (⏳ → ✅)
- Add notes about blockers or decisions
- Keep phase documentation current

### 3. Quality Gates
- Each phase must meet success criteria
- Run tests before marking tasks complete
- Get review before phase transitions

### 4. Realistic Timing
- 4-week phases are optimal
- Include buffer for unexpected issues
- Don't rush phase completion

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Systems

### Requirements System (`/requirements/`)
- Detailed specifications feed into phase planning
- Requirements map to specific phase deliverables
- Use requirement IDs in task descriptions

### Documentation (`/docs/`)
- Update relevant docs as phases complete
- Architecture decisions recorded in ADRs
- API documentation stays current

### Branch Strategy
- Development happens on feature branches
- Phase completion triggers branch integration
- Production deployments follow phase milestones

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Phase Progress Indicators
- **⏳ Pending**: Task not started
- **🔄 In Progress**: Actively working
- **✅ Complete**: Task finished and tested
- **❌ Blocked**: Waiting on dependency

### Milestone Markers
- **Week 1-4**: Sprint boundaries
- **Review Checkpoints**: Weekly progress checks
- **Phase Completion**: All tasks ✅

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Health
- Test coverage > 80%
- Build time < 5 minutes
- Zero critical bugs

### Development Velocity
- Phase completion on schedule
- Reduced scope creep incidents
- Clear handoffs between phases

### Team Satisfaction
- Clear understanding of goals
- Predictable workload
- Celebrated milestones

## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong

### Scope Creep
1. Identify the new requirement
2. Document in future phase
3. Stay focused on current phase
4. Revisit during planning

### Blocked Tasks
1. Document the blocker clearly
2. Find alternative approaches
3. Escalate if critical path
4. Update phase timeline if needed

### Phase Delays
1. Assess remaining work honestly
2. Update timeline in phase doc
3. Communicate impact on future phases
4. Consider scope reduction

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Automated progress tracking from Git
- Integration with project management tools
- Real-time dashboard for phase status
- AI-assisted phase planning
