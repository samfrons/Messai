- **Performance verification**: Power output ranges from 30 to 125,000 mW/m²
- **Feature coverage**: 92 unique features, 52 applications, 57 materials

## Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Filtering & Search
```typescript
// Filter by multiple criteria
const filteredSystems = systems
  .filter(s => s.category === 'high-performance')
  .filter(s => s.scale === 'pilot')
  .filter(s => standardizePowerOutput(s) > 1000)

// Smart search across multiple fields
const searchResults = searchSystems('quantum MXene')
```

### Unified System Types
- **Experimental Systems**: Ready for experiment creation
- **Research Models**: Literature-backed with implementation guidance
- **Hybrid Systems**: Some systems support both experimentation and research

### Power Output Standardization
```typescript
// All power outputs normalized for comparison
const standardPower = standardizePowerOutput(system)
// Handles: mW/m², W/m², W/m³, mW/m³ → normalized to mW/m²
```

### Smart Related Systems
```typescript
// AI-powered similarity scoring
const related = getRelatedSystems(systemId, 5)
// Based on: category, scale, tags, power output similarity
```
