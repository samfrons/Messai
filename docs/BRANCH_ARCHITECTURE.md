## ⚙️ **Development Workflow**

### **Feature Development Process**

1. **Choose Development Branch**
   ```bash
   # For research features
   git checkout research-development
   
   # For lab features  
   git checkout lab-development
   
   # For experiment features
   git checkout experiments-development
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # Develop your feature
   git commit -am "Implement feature"
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test on development branch
   git checkout research-development
   git merge feature/your-feature-name
   npm test
   ```

4. **Deploy to Production Branches**
   ```bash
   # Merge to appropriate production branches
   git checkout messai-research
   git merge research-development
   
   git checkout research-lab  
   git merge research-development
   ```

### **Branch Synchronization**

- **Weekly Sync**: Development branches sync with master
- **Feature Merge**: Features merge to development branches first
- **Production Deploy**: Development branches merge to production branches
- **Hotfixes**: Critical fixes can merge directly to production branches
